  <h4>A little history</h4>
     <p> <cite>Tim Berners Lee</cite> is credited with creating the world wide web and HTML. </p>
      
      The World Wide Web (W3) initiative links related information throughout the globe.  HTML provides one simple format for    providing linked information, and  all W3 compatible programs are
   required to be capable of handling HTML. W3 uses an Internet
   protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP), which allows transfer
   representations to be negotiated between client and server, the
   result being returned in an extended MIME message.  HTML is
   therefore just one, but an important one, of the representations
   used with W3.</p>
